It was a cold cold night on the north side of Boston when it happend. Jaime looked up with some sort of awe while he held the object in his hands. 
"What .. What do you think it is Patty?" he said while getting off of his right knee. 
"I ... I don't think I've ever seen one of those in person before!" Patty said with excitement in her voice.



Their excitement was cut short by the chopping sound of helicopter blades. With no time to fawn over their new acquisition, they had to run! They couldn't let the Evil Organization(TM) take hold of their Valuable Artifact(TM)! In their haste they tread asphalt like jetskis over a rivers of oil, and turned the buildings they passed into blurs. Fortunately, helicopters can't fly low over city streets, and Patty was able to settle Jamie and herself down at a nearby pizza parlour.
